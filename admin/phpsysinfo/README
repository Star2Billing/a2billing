	If your platform is not here try checking out the mailing list archives or
	the message boards on SourceForge.
	
	PHP 5.2 is known to be broken with phpSysInfo. There is allready a bug report
	on the php site. ( see http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=39737 )

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
------------------------------
	Just decompress and untar the source (which you should have done by now,
	if you're reading this...), into your webserver's document root.

	There is a configuration file called config.php.new. If this a brand new
	installation, you should copy this file to config.php and edit it.

	-	make sure your 'php.ini' file's include_path entry contains "."
	-	make sure your 'php.ini' has safe_mode set to 'off'.
	
	Please keep in the mind that because phpSysInfo requires access to many
	files in /proc and other system binary you **MUST DISABLE** php's
	safe_mode.  Please see the PHP documentation for information on how you
	can do this.
	
	If you use the apc pecl extension with apc.optimization="1" then
	phpSysInfo will	break in the XPath.class. Turn this option off, and it
	will work with apc.
	
	That's it.  Restart your webserver (if you changed php.ini), and viola
	
KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------
	-	phpSysInfo is not compatible with SELinux Systems
	-	small bug under FreeBSD with memory reporting

PLATFORM SPECIFIC ISSUES
------------------------
	-	FreeBSD
		There is currently a bug in FreeBSD that if you boot your system up 
		and	drop to single user mode and then again back to multiuser the 
		system removes /var/run/dmesg.boot.  This will cause phpsysinfo to
		fail. A bug	has already been reported to the FreeBSD team. (PS, this
		may exist in other *BSDs also)
		!!! We need feedback if these issue is still alive !!!
	- 	Windows with IIS
		On Windows systems we get our informations through the WMI interface.
		If you run phpsysinfo on the IIS webserver, phpsysinfo will not connect
		to the WMI interface for security reasons. At this point you MUST set
		an authentication mechanism for the directory in the IIS admin
		interface for the directory where phpsysinfo is installed. Then you
		will be asked for an user and a password when opening the page. At this
		point it is necassary to log in with an user that will be able to 
		connect to the WMI interface. If you use the wrong user and/or password
		you might get an "ACCESS DENIED ERROR".

SENSOR RELATET INFORMATIONS
---------------------------
	-	MBM5
		Make sure you set MBM5 Interval Logging to csv and to the data
		directory of PHPSysInfo. The file must be called MBM5. Also make sure
		MBM5 doesn't add symbols to the	values. Did is a Quick MBM5 log	parser,
		need more csv logs to make it better.

WHAT TO DO IF IT DOESN'T WORK
-----------------------------
	First make sure you've read this file completely, especially the
	"INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION" section.  If it still doesn't work then
	you can:
	
	Submit a bug on SourceForge. (preferred)
		(http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpsysinfo/)
	Ask for help in the forum
		(http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpsysinfo/)
	
	!! If you submit a bug or request some help, if something doesn't work,
	please check that you have set in config.php '$showerrors = true' !!!
