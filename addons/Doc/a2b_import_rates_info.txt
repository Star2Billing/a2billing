To import rate cards, your cvs file has to be formatted in a specific way.

1)
	Obtain your vendors rates in cvs.

2) 
	Open it in your favorite spreadsheet or database editor.

3) 
	Find and arrange the columns so that the first three are:
		dialprefix - dial prefix
		destination - country
		rate initial - how much you charge

4) 
	Find any of the other fields in your file that have data such as:
		buyrate - how much you pay provider per minute
		buyrateinitblock - minimum time provider bills you
		buyrateincrement - billing time increment from provider
		initblock - minimum time your bill caller
		billingblock - billing time increment to caller
		connect charge  - connect charge to caller
		disconnect charge - disconnect charge to caller
		(there are additional fields not listed here available as well)                          
		Once you have found them, we suggest renaming them appropriately to lessen confusion.
		
	You may also find some cvs files have the country and city code in seperate fields, 
	you going to have to append the latter to the first and call it dialprefix.

5) 
	Check that the field arrangement has the following order: dialprefix, destination, rate initial
	Additional fields can be in any order you like, but take note of the order for later.

6) 
	Preparing the file to import.
	The file has to be cvs format. Comma seperated format, but we cant use commas. 
	The accepted characters are: ';'  ':' 
	You must save the file using one of the above as the seperator.
	You can use excel to edit the file and an editor to find and replace all ',' with ';' 
	and save in the Unix Unicode UT8 format.
	
	Your file should look like this:
		dialprefix;destination;rate initial;buyrate;initblock
		119370;afghanistan cellular;0.8135;0.3135;30
		1193;afghanistan proper;0.7866;0.2866;30
		1135538;albania cellular;0.7076;0.2076;30

7)
	Open the a2billing page in your browser. 
	Find : Import RateCard
	
	'Choose the ratecard to import', 
	'Choose the trunk to use',
	'Choose the additionnal field that you want to import from your cvs file'
	
	Here you will add any additional fields you described in the file.
	Select the field and use the right green arrow to bring over. 
	Do this for all fields you have in the file. Make sure they are in the order
	you noted earler. Make any order adjustments by selecting and using the
	red up/down arrows to move.

8) 
	Once you are finished "Choose File" and then "Import RateCard". If all is well
	you will see all of your field headers match up. Once you confirm they do, 
	hit "Continue to Import the RateCard". (It may ask you to select the file again)

9) 
	You will then get a confirmation of how many rates were successfully imported.
