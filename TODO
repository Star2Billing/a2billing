                   			TODO LIST - SPECIFIC
********************************************************************************

#### TODO : GENERATE VOUCHER & GENERATE CARD
********************************************************************
In the generate option, the tag value is set to a random ID : 1181897201
this allow us to see exactly after the generation those that has been created!
If someone really use the tag feature to classify his voucher, this can be bit annoying! 
we need to give the option to define the tag to a specific value or to use the random number.

We can add a new field in cc_card for this :
ALTER TABLE cc_card ADD COLUMN tag CHAR(50);
We should add a reseach by tag too on View card.

Consider 2 trunks configured like this:
#1: trunkprefix=8888 removeprefix=0 failover=trunk #2
#2: trunkprefix=8889 removeprefix=0 failover=-1/none

When dialing 0123456789 the call is presented to trunk #1 as it should be:
888812345678

If the call fails over each of the successive attempts will add the correct prefix, but not remove the desired digits:

#### AUTO CREATE CARD
********************************************************************
Creating an Account from the Caller ID
there is no setting for currency, so despite the fact that I had set the base currency to Euro, it created an account in USD. 
Maybe the account should be setup in the Base currency by default ?



#### MISC
********************************************************************
1. Voice over ring tone.
how to simulate:  Set up multiaccess on the user account,  answer=no (in a2billing.conf). 
sometimes u can hear (durring the other party phone rings) a voice with "and then pres pound key" over the ring tone.
 
2. Can not call users alias with 9+alias  , again answer=no in a2billing.conf
 
3. Soft Phone dont work.






#### UPDATE STATUS IN PAYPAL AND MONEY BOOKERS
********************************************************************
We should have the way to manage the Pending transactions !!!

There is a interface Provideded by paypal and Money bookers to get status of pending transactions
so that later on admin can update the status of transactions which were pending by quering the Epayment Gateway

so that if any Payment is Pending, the Admin can check the Status of Transaction 
this will actually query the epayment gateway to provide the status of transaction 
we will need to build the admin interface to see the transactions that are pending
so that admin can click on update button to update the status


#### FEATURE IN VIEW FRAMEWORK TO SHOW A BUTTON ACCORDING TO THE VALUE OF ONE OF THE FIELD

#### Check voice one

#### INVOICE IMPROVE SENDING
********************************************************************
when you send invoices, there is no "to pay" field
they might paid just a part of last invoice
so a "current balance to pay" would be probably usefull
maybe they had $50 in january and $30 in february and they only paid $20 in february, 
so in march invoice, they have $20 but they need to pay $20 + $50 + $30 - $20

#### BUGS
********************************************************************
1. The notify user (send_reminder) when min_credit_2call is reached doesn't seem to work. I have made the changes in a2billing.conf but still no email is sent to user, how do i get this working?

2. Is it possible to have the reminder sent at a differnt value than the min_credit_2call? 


Reason for this is, I would like a reminder to be sent when a user has £x credit left in their account but the user should still be able to use the account with the current balance. At the moment the only way to achieve this is to set the min_credit_2call=0 (this way the user gets to use every penny in their account) but by this time i think the reminder that is being sent when credit=0 is too late.

#### BUG : DID BILLING
********************************************************************
bug DID billing
we create a DID with no monthly cost for instance free or just dialout cost!!
When the use take the DID from the customer interface, it still have to pay for it
we dont check the billingtype of DID


#### BUG : DID  (not urgent)
********************************************************************
I Create a Card when I dont have  any DID Group
and I Simply Go and Create DID Group
and Create a Destination and Bind it with a Card
Go to the Client Side You will see the Destination in the Card
but when you will go to edit the Destination you will see the DIDGroup List is Not Loaded



#### RIGHT MANAGEMENT
********************************************************************
when u use this : "Add DID" and we assign a DID to a card
a check should be proceed, if the DID don't belong to the user's DID group then it should warn the user/admin





######## CREDIT RESERVE - SIMULTANEOUS ACCESS
********************************************************************

Wouldn't this mean on simultaneous access, callers could go negative in balance if subsequent calls were made while balance still exists?
http://forum.a2billing.net/viewtopic.php?t=1759&highlight=


Does the same account allow for simultaneous calls?
Yes. Here's how it works: Say you have a balance of ten (10) dollars. When your first call comes in, two hours worth of credit is temporarily frozen. So, if you are calling a destination that costs 2 cents a minute, that means $2.40 (2 cents/min x 120 minutes) has been frozen in your account. This leaves $7.60 available for another simultaneous call. When that second call comes in, more of your balance is frozen. You can keep making simultaneous calls so long as your effective balance is above zero. When calls are completed, the balance that was frozen is released and once again available for use. If you have a low balance, there's no sense in letting many simultaneous calls go through, only to have them all disconnect at the same time when your balance hits zero (what most carriers do).

thoughts to adding timezone to cc_card ? It's great that we've got language and currency so they can view items in their local currency. Why not have option for timezone so the CDR's are listed in their local times instead of where the switch is located?

- payment: send payment emails to customers when "Add Payment" is used; send an email out of a template saying something like "thank you for payment of XXX made on YYYY...."; maybe the ability to display the payment history on the customer web site to see if they paid the bill or not

#### BUG []
********************************************************************

	Line 382 in a2billing.php has:
					   if (substr($A2B->CallerID,0,1)=='0'){
						   $A2B ->dnid = $A2B ->destination =
	$caller_areacode.substr($A2B->CallerID,1);
					   }else{
						   $A2B ->dnid = $A2B ->destination =
	$caller_areacode.$A2B->CallerID;
					   }
					   $agi->verbose('line:'.__LINE__.' - '.'[destination:
	- '.$A2B->destination.']');
	
	[a2billing-cid-callback]
	exten => _X.,1,DeadAGI(a2billing.php|1|cid-callback|34) ;last
	parameter is the callback area code
	exten => _X.,2,Hangup
	
	As u see the last parameter is the area code and from instance :
	if I am in Belgium and use a local DID for callback but my server are
	in UK, the system will probably not know that it needs to call me back
	over the prefix 32, that's why is needed.
	So in this case my cell number 0473510969, a2b will be call me as 32473510969.
	That s the meaning of the remaining zero and it makes sense to set a parameter 
	for the leading zero if you are
	already in the local country.

********************************************************************
Suggestion from Vahan
	1. First of all I'd suggest to introduce one single yet simple config
	option in a2billing.conf: silent=yes|no that allows to turn off all the
	voice prompts in the case a2billing.php has successfully authenticated
	the caller-id/card number and if the assosiated card number has enough
	credit. Currently you have to disable several announce configs for this.

	2. add an option to filter by first name / last name too in the card picker.

	3. Please first name to the list to as a separate column or merged with
	last name. It's difficult to track people by their lastnames only.
	Areski : I propose more to get rid of lastname and include a new feature to 
	roll over the row and get more info. it will keep up a clear design

e.) at the form of adding/changing SIP/IAX user there should be a possibilty to erase some parameters. like if there isn't any entry (example in canreinvite) that this also don't will be printed to the sip-config.

5.) BUG : if the debug level in /etc/asterisk/a2billing.conf will be activated to 1, 2 or 3 there sould be a DEBUG from the AGI-scripts to the log_file. But I've seen, that many debugging information will not be printed to the logfile.
 
So the statments "if ($A2B->agiconfig['debug']>=1) " don't work even the debug is set (i printed out the debug and I've seen it that the entry is correct. Maybe there is a mistake in the $agi->verbose but I don't looked there because it isn't so urgent to fix it.
 
Here is a example (the first line is from me and will printed out, the $A2B->agiconfig['debug'] = 2 but the two verbose don't will be printed to the log_file) :
 
# diff /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/a2billing.php

Petite question: je suis entrain de mettre en place des routes et ai
trouvé un truc que tu pourrais incorporer d'origine: un TRUNK nommé
NotAllowed (exemple), ProvideIP=NoProvider. Dans les scripts, lorsque tu
rencontres ce peer, soit tu ne fais rien et envois le message - le
numéro composé n'est pas disponible - ce qui est le cas actuellement
parceque * ne trouve pas ce host et renvoit un code erreur a A2Billing,
soit tu permets d'appeller une extension de type 100@default ou
Local/default/200 ou ... qui permettrait de personnaliser l'annonce/le
traitement.

Pourquoi je pense à ca? Prenons la FR comme ex: les routes vers les
numéros 8xx. sont compliquées: soit c'est gratuit (Freebox et consors)
soit c'est ultra-payant :-( Si je dois autoriser les règles une à une,
ca se complique. Avec ce système, j'interdis (donc TRUNK=NotAllowed) la
destination 338 puis je n'ouvre que les routes 338x que je veux ;-)

WIKI TO HAVE + SEVERAL A2B ON THE SAME BOX
------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can program in a2billing.conf several configurations but only
to set different behaviour for the "agi" not for the rest of the
system.

Well in your case if you want to make coexist 2+ a2billing platforms
on the same box,
you will have to trick a little bit. There is a file call
Class.A2Billing.php in each components (web, agi, web-cust) and at the
beginning of it there is the definition to select the conf files

define('AST_CONFIG_DIR', '/etc/asterisk/');
...
define('DEFAULT_A2BILLING_CONFIG', AST_CONFIG_DIR . '/a2billing.conf');


so you can create a new db
duplicate the web interface in other directory and all files for the agi and
for instance copy those last in /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/namecustomer/

change the file
/var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/namecustomer/libs_a2billing/Class.A2Billing.php

with for instance
define('DEFAULT_A2BILLING_CONFIG', AST_CONFIG_DIR .
'/a2billing.namecustomer.conf');

etc...

2) In most billing systems identification of customer is not associated with
PIN code. Most usual and flexible way is to add the term of account.  The
account has associated with it PIN codes, CLIDs and other methods of
providing services. For example you have a corporative customer that is
company with 15 employees. These all people use PIN codes, their cell phones
callerids also used for access. They just call and call but money for calls
everytime taken from ONE account and they don't have to think about their
personal account balance, the company has one account for all PINs and
CLIDs. This is usual practise for most billing systems. This
company-customer can get the report in any time and look how many calls were
made by employees and how much money they spent from the account and how
many money were spent by all employees instead of looking the personal
accounts of all employees.
