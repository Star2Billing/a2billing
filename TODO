********************************************************************************

#### TODO : function do_field
********************************************************************
function do_field($sql,$fld,$dbfld){

This function is defined in many places, need to create in misc.php
and remove it from other page where it s used (mainly in report section)


#### TODO : ARCHIVE CDRs & Cards
********************************************************************
We will create cc_call_archive && cc_card_archive
table with the same structure cc_call where id will be primary key.
So we can build a cront application that will weekly, retrieve all the CDRs
older than X months move them to cc_call_archive and then
explain the Database and rebuild index so that it start to be fast again.
X Month will be in parameter in config

Think to better solution maybe !?
+
** WEB INTERFACE **

Maybe a web interface similar at the massmail Archive, with 2 options for customer and CDR
so we should be able to make a selection of the USER and move them to the archive table
same for the CDR cc_call


#### TODO : add call-limit
********************************************************************
Add call-limit on sip/iax parameters





### STORAGE & DISCLOSURE
********************************************************************
If you are a proper telecom company, in most countries, those details are classified. So, you have to be careful about
their storage and disclosure.
One thing is that for customers, resellers and some ACL admins, I try to hide the last 3 digits of the call.
Other is that logging in /tmp etc. should *not* contain the full call details. 
It is easier to only have the full details in the database, and then be careful about not letting the db 
data in public.



#### FEATURE : CUSTOMER SERVICES FRIENDLY
********************************************************************

#### TRUNK REPORTING PAGE - DASH BOARD
********************************************************************
A screen page where you can see the call stats Expl. ASR, ALOC, CIC  from each trunk on one web page.


#### FEATURE : USE ADODB CACHING IN THE FRAMEWORK
********************************************************************
Use adoDB caching in the framework
many part can be improve, most of all the part when we bound to a view to other table
for each field we run a little query. Caching here will save a lot!

for instance if you put the sql debug on Class.Table, you will see that on all the view 
there is lot lot of query performed cause for all the LIE action made on view
a query is perform so if you view 20 records on a page u will have all the sql query of the page more 20 sql select for the LIE to find back some information
the sample of card
$HD_Form -> AddViewElement(gettext("Call Plan"), "tariff", "10%", "center", "sort", "15", "lie", "cc_tariffgroup", "tariffgroupname", "id='%id'", "%1");
you have a LIE here to see the tariffgroup name so if you view lot of card, you will do a lot of sql query

then the second call to the next gtwy and then the next call to the next gtwy.



#### BUG : FAILOVER
********************************************************************
http://forum.asterisk2billing.org/viewtopic.php?t=2243

Consider 2 trunks configured like this:
#1: trunkprefix=8888 removeprefix=0 failover=trunk #2
#2: trunkprefix=8889 removeprefix=0 failover=-1/none

When dialing 0123456789 the call is presented to trunk #1 as it should be:
888812345678

If the call fails over each of the successive attempts will add the correct prefix, but not remove the desired digits:
88890123456789


#### BUG : SIGNUP

http://forum.asterisk2billing.org/viewtopic.php?t=93&highlight=voicemail


You need to create the appropiated line for each extension at the voicemail.conf file. Add the following lines to your a2billing context to give your clients the voicemail feature:

Code:

[vmmain]
exten => *97,1,Answer
exten => *97,n,Wait(1)
exten => *97,n,VoiceMailMain(${CALLERID(num)}@default)
exten => *97,n,Hangup

#### WEB SYSTEM TO AUTOMATE UPDATE OF RATECARD
********************************************************************
Web system to automate update of ratecard

changed rates : the 15th -> 00:00 and the 1st -> 00:00
GMT : 0


#### AUTO CREATE CARD
********************************************************************
Creating an Account from the Caller ID
there is no setting for currency, so despite the fact that I had set the base currency to Euro, it created an account in USD. 
Maybe the account should be setup in the Base currency by default ?



#### MISC
********************************************************************
1. Voice over ring tone.
how to simulate:  Set up multiaccess on the user account,  answer=no (in a2billing.conf). 
sometimes u can hear (durring the other party phone rings) a voice with "and then pres pound key" over the ring tone.
 
2. Can not call users alias with 9+alias  , again answer=no in a2billing.conf
 
3. Soft Phone dont work.




#### UPDATE STATUS IN PAYPAL AND MONEY BOOKERS
********************************************************************
We should have the way to manage the Pending transactions !!!

There is a interface Provideded by paypal and Money bookers to get status of pending transactions
so that later on admin can update the status of transactions which were pending by quering the Epayment Gateway

so that if any Payment is Pending, the Admin can check the Status of Transaction 
this will actually query the epayment gateway to provide the status of transaction 
we will need to build the admin interface to see the transactions that are pending
so that admin can click on update button to update the status


#### FEATURE IN VIEW FRAMEWORK TO SHOW A BUTTON ACCORDING TO THE VALUE OF ONE OF THE FIELD
********************************************************************
what will happend when a invoice is paid
we should not show the pay invoice button then 
is there anything in framework that support like this?


#### FEATURES : CALLBACK dont bill 1st if not connected
********************************************************************
add a parameter to not bill 1st if not connected
callback_bill_1stleg_ifcall_notconnected = YES / NO



#### Check voice one 
********************************************************************
SIP JAVA Phone


#### INVOICE IMPROVE SENDING
********************************************************************
when you send invoices, there is no "to pay" field
they might paid just a part of last invoice
so a "current balance to pay" would be probably usefull
maybe they had $50 in january and $30 in february and they only paid $20 in february, 
so in march invoice, they have $20 but they need to pay $20 + $50 + $30 - $20




#### DID CRONT : MAIL
********************************************************************
$mail_user_content.="BALANCE REMAINING ".$mydids[5]-$mydids[3]."\n\n";
$mail_user_content.="A automaticly taking away of :".$mydids[3]." has been carry out of your acount \n\n";	
$mail_user_content.="Monthly Fixrate for DID :".$mydids[0]."\n\n";
$mail_user=true;
$mail_user_subject="DID notification";

use mail template 
(maybe after the release :D not urgent)

#### IMPORT FEATURE WITH INTERVAL & RANGE

#### BUGS
********************************************************************
1. The notify user (send_reminder) when min_credit_2call is reached doesn't seem to work. I have made the changes in a2billing.conf but still no email is sent to user, how do i get this working?

2. Is it possible to have the reminder sent at a differnt value than the min_credit_2call? 


Reason for this is, I would like a reminder to be sent when a user has £x credit left in their account but the user should still be able to use the account with the current balance. At the moment the only way to achieve this is to set the min_credit_2call=0 (this way the user gets to use every penny in their account) but by this time i think the reminder that is being sent when credit=0 is too late.


#### OnLine Payment 
********************************************************************
Checkout Google


#### BUG : DID BILLING
********************************************************************
bug DID billing
we create a DID with no monthly cost for instance free or just dialout cost!!
When the use take the DID from the customer interface, it still have to pay for it
we dont check the billingtype of DID


#### BUG : DID  (not urgent)
********************************************************************
I Create a Card when I dont have  any DID Group
and I Simply Go and Create DID Group
and Create a Destination and Bind it with a Card
Go to the Client Side You will see the Destination in the Card
but when you will go to edit the Destination you will see the DIDGroup List is Not Loaded



#### RIGHT MANAGEMENT
********************************************************************
when u use this : "Add DID" and we assign a DID to a card
a check should be proceed, if the DID don't belong to the user's DID group then it should warn the user/admin





######## CREDIT RESERVE - SIMULTANEOUS ACCESS
********************************************************************

Wouldn't this mean on simultaneous access, callers could go negative in balance if subsequent calls were made while balance still exists?
http://forum.a2billing.net/viewtopic.php?t=1759&highlight=


Does the same account allow for simultaneous calls?
Yes. Here's how it works: Say you have a balance of ten (10) dollars. When your first call comes in, two hours worth of credit is temporarily frozen. So, if you are calling a destination that costs 2 cents a minute, that means $2.40 (2 cents/min x 120 minutes) has been frozen in your account. This leaves $7.60 available for another simultaneous call. When that second call comes in, more of your balance is frozen. You can keep making simultaneous calls so long as your effective balance is above zero. When calls are completed, the balance that was frozen is released and once again available for use. If you have a low balance, there's no sense in letting many simultaneous calls go through, only to have them all disconnect at the same time when your balance hits zero (what most carriers do).

#### FEATURE : ADD RANGE CARDNUMBER IN CARDGENERATOR
********************************************************************
let's the user define a range of cardnumber (ie: 45000-46000)
+ option to check if there is a cards already between this range (interval limit 10000)


#### FEATURE : SIGN-UP for tracking...
********************************************************************
working out the source of a signup so that comission can be paid. 
a link to the signup be created that enters the source of the link against 
the customer, e.g. an agent name or website address?


#### FEATURE
********************************************************************
thoughts to adding timezone to cc_card ? It's great that we've got language and currency so they can view items in their local currency. Why not have option for timezone so the CDR's are listed in their local times instead of where the switch is located?
I borrowed this idea from SER. I can get you their database table they use if you like. It makes it easy for user instead of asking for +/- GMT, has items such as:


#### FEATURE
********************************************************************
Marcel

- invoices: keep an end of the month balance and send automatically invoices at the end of the month using an email template and attaching a html invoice report; fields in the template would include name, last month balance, current month payments, current month per minute charges, DIDs and other charges, etc.

- payment: send payment emails to customers when "Add Payment" is used; send an email out of a template saying something like "thank you for payment of XXX made on YYYY...."; maybe the ability to display the payment history on the customer web site to see if they paid the bill or not 

"Add Payment" do not refill the account, you have to do refill manually.
- Adding a feature there to make an auto refill



#### FEATURE
********************************************************************
some info report
http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/showthread.php?threadid=3477


#### FEATURE
********************************************************************
ADD REPORTING PAGE TO VIEW :
- 20 users making the more call
- 20 more call destination

20 might be a parameters
we need to see the total time and sell made by this clause group
etc...


#### NOTE
********************************************************************
Note to areski – should we be able to define international access prefixes? 00 UK & Europe, 
011 USA , but 0099 for South Africa. See http://kropla.com/dialcode.htm IDD column

Note to Areski – why have free as an option, surely if I wanted free, I would set fixrate to 0?




	
#### NEW TASK
********************************************************************
Yep - having a separate figure for VAT would be useful
for VAT returns
however - UK VAT laws say that if a call originates outside of the EU, then no VAT is required on the call
however if a call starts within the EU, the VAT is payable




#### NEW TASK []
********************************************************************
Card company can set default language and customer can change 1. English 2. Dutch, 3. French etc.
make it more easily customizable





#### Improvement []
********************************************************************
There are problems with multiple calls if the credit is running low.
The system should secure a certain amount from the credit once the
user is logged in.


#### []
********************************************************************
//// IMPORTANT 
Ben Pintilie <ben@energyradio.co.uk>
Going to offer professional recording :D
- rework on the IVR text 




#### []
********************************************************************
e.) at the form of adding/changing SIP/IAX user there should be a possibilty to erase some parameters. like if there isn't any entry (example in canreinvite) that this also don't will be printed to the sip-config. Beause some parameter should be better to define in general without any possibility of overwriting

#### []
********************************************************************

d) different SIP/IAX files for each administrator/account- so with this there would be a possibility for a better differnece of two persons which handle the system and don't overwrite any manual config or/and a better usefull possibility for special definitions for the caller if he want to change like the "callerid" or anything else



#### []
********************************************************************
Petite question: je suis entrain de mettre en place des routes et ai
trouvé un truc que tu pourrais incorporer d'origine: un TRUNK nommé
NotAllowed (exemple), ProvideIP=NoProvider. Dans les scripts, lorsque tu
rencontres ce peer, soit tu ne fais rien et envois le message - le
numéro composé n'est pas disponible - ce qui est le cas actuellement
parceque * ne trouve pas ce host et renvoit un code erreur a A2Billing,
soit tu permets d'appeller une extension de type 100@default ou
Local/default/200 ou ... qui permettrait de personnaliser l'annonce/le
traitement.

Pourquoi je pense à ca? Prenons la FR comme ex: les routes vers les
numéros 8xx. sont compliquées: soit c'est gratuit (Freebox et consors)
soit c'est ultra-payant :-( Si je dois autoriser les règles une à une,
ca se complique. Avec ce système, j'interdis (donc TRUNK=NotAllowed) la
destination 338 puis je n'ouvre que les routes 338x que je veux ;-)



#### CURRENCY BY RATECARD 
********************************************************************
Rates : it should be possible to enter rates in different currencies for each ratecard.
I have 3 providers : a danish who list prices in DKK, a english who lists prices in EUR, and a US who list prices in USD.



#### DID : answer with voice on unassigned did.
********************************************************************
Needed DID improvement :
;audio played when receiving call on DID with no assigned destination

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////


WIKI TO HAVE + SEVERAL A2B ON THE SAME BOX
------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can program in a2billing.conf several configurations but only
to set different behaviour for the "agi" not for the rest of the
system.

Well in your case if you want to make coexist 2+ a2billing platforms
on the same box,
you will have to trick a little bit. There is a file call
Class.A2Billing.php in each components (web, agi, web-cust) and at the
beginning of it there is the definition to select the conf files

define('AST_CONFIG_DIR', '/etc/asterisk/');
...
define('DEFAULT_A2BILLING_CONFIG', AST_CONFIG_DIR . '/a2billing.conf');


so you can create a new db
duplicate the web interface in other directory and all files for the agi and
for instance copy those last in /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/namecustomer/

change the file
/var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/namecustomer/libs_a2billing/Class.A2Billing.php

with for instance
define('DEFAULT_A2BILLING_CONFIG', AST_CONFIG_DIR .
'/a2billing.namecustomer.conf');

etc...
